# About
Here's my completed Scara code.  As with my other projects, it can be
built with `conan build .` and run form the `./build/Release/scara_lab`
binary.  The testing binary can be found at `./build/Release/test_suite`.
Sadly, the testing suite is pretty light on the later half of things.  Given
constraints from other from other course work, I didn't spend as much time
on this as it deserved, but I think it has reasonably well covered the
provided brief.
