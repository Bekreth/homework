# Lab 03
## About
This lab focuses on being able to successfully use functions and handle I/O.  The main objectives are as follows:
1. All functions should continue operation unless user exists sub-application
2. A factorial functions shouldd exist with proper bounds
3. A rectangular to polar coordinate coverter should exist with outputs between -180 and 180 degrees
4. A fibonacci function should exist that outputs the number of the fibonacci sequence and a star string 
   of matching length

## Building and Running
This build assumes you are on a unix environment with Make and gcc installed to reasonable versions
```sh
make run
```
